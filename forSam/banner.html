						Hi love, I’ve been thinking a lot about how amazing you are, and I just wanted to put it into
						words. Every single day, I’m in awe of how hard you’re working to become a registered nurse. The
						dedication and passion you put into everything you doit’s incredible. I know that one day,
						you’ll be out there making such a huge difference in people's lives, and honestly, that’s one of
						the things I love most about you. You care so deeply, and it shows in everything you do.
					</div>
					<div class="py-3">
						Being by your side as your boyfriend, and knowing that someday I'll get to call you my wife,
						makes me feel like the luckiest guy in the world. I can't wait for the future we're building
						togetherwhether it's celebrating your accomplishments, supporting each other through tough
						times, or just the simple moments we share. You inspire me to be better, to dream bigger, and to
						never stop growing. I’m so proud of everything you're achieving and who you are, Sam.
					</div>
					<div class="py-3">
						Sorry if may mga times na sobrang kulit or matigas ulo ko. I know there are moments where I
						haven’t been the best version of myself—sorry din if may mga times na sobrang red flag ko for
						you. Sorry din if madalas tayong nagkakatampuhan, and I know na madalas akong nagtatampo. But
						despite all of that, lagi mong tatandaan na mahal na mahal kita, and I’m always here for you. No
						matter what, I’ll always be cheering you on, supporting you, and loving you. I can’t wait for
						all the things life has in store for us. I love you more than words can say.
					</div>

					<div class="py-3">
						I love you so much, Love, more than I can put into words. You’re my everything, and I can’t wait
						for what’s next for us. We’ve got so many dreams to chase and so much to look forward to. Thank
						you for being my partner, my love, and the person I want to spend the rest of my life with.

						Each picture holds a memory, and every moment we’ve shared means the world to me. From the

						laughs to the big milestones, I’m so grateful for all the adventures we’ve had together. Looking
						back at these reminds me of how lucky I am to have you by my side, and I can’t wait to make more
						memories with you in the future. Kaya ito yung magiging pinaka core at motivation ko sa araw
						araw to
						keep going, to love harder, and to always cherish what we have. Here’s to us, to love, and to
						everything we’ve yet to experience. I love you, always.

					<div class="py-3">
						Love, every time I hear the song Intertwine by Over October, I can’t help but think of you and
						how perfect it feels for us. The lyrics, the emotions it’s like the song was made to capture
						everything we’ve been through and everything I feel for you. I can’t even count how many times
						I’ve listened to it, but one thing is constant ikaw at ikaw talaga yung naiisip ko every single
						time. It’s like every note and every word brings me back to you, to all our memories, and to the
						future I’m so excited to build with you.
					</div>

					<div class="py-3">
						As always, ito yung song na talagang for you. It’s my way of reminding myself how much you mean
						to me, how deeply I love you. You’re the one I want now, tomorrow, and for the rest of my life.
						Mahal ko, hindi kita iiwan, no matter what. You’ve become such a big part of who I am and what
						keeps me going. This song is just one of the many ways I can tell you how much you mean to me,
						but my love for you goes beyond words. I love you, always and forever.

						I know that life can get busy, especially with everything going on around us right now. It can sometimes feel overwhelming, but basta if maging busy man tayo both, I promise that after ng midterms, babawi ako for you. I’m committed to making it up to you in every way possible because you deserve all my time and attention. I’ll make sure we’ll sulitin lahat ng araw na available tayo just you and me, creating new memories and enjoying each other’s company without distractions. You’re the one I want to cherish every moment with, now and in the future, and I truly believe we can make every moment count.
